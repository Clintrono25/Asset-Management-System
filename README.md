# Asset-Management-System
<b><u>Android &amp; Web Based Application For Asset Management</u></b>


Asset Management System has a web-based system where all the records can be viewed and managed. An
employee who has the role of managing the system will be able to update the records by removing items that have
been returned from the list and whenever an item is being issued out, the records are updated and made visible on the
list of items on issue.
The android app will be scanning QR code attached to a specific device and decode to reveal the items information
e.g., machine type, model number and the name. This app can be installed on any android phone or tablet. The app
should also be able to scan the employee’s identity card using the optical character recognition and pick the characters
on the card e.g., full names and identification number. All these are recorded directly into the database. Employees’
details when searched on the database should be able to show which devices they have and for how long are the items
assigned to them. It should also show the expected date and time of return. On the database end, when an item is
returned, the employee returning the item should be able to be cleared and the records updated automatically. All this
saves the whole process of manually keeping and managing the records of devices and employees.
